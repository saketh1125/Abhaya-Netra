# 🛡️ Abhaya-Netra  
### Agentic, Offline Deepfake Detection System for Field & Operational Environments

Abhaya-Netra is an **agent-driven deepfake detection system** designed to autonomously **identify, analyse and respond to synthetic audio/video media in realtime** across:

• Operational environments  
• Tactical/Field deployments  
• Open-source & public media channels  

It is built **offline-first**, enabling secure deployment on **smartphones, handheld tactical devices and body-worn cameras** — without sending media to the cloud.

---

## 🎯 Mission Objective

To create a **reliable, fast, autonomous deepfake detection agent** that:

✔ Operates across **cloud, edge & field devices**  
✔ Works **fully offline when required**  
✔ Runs efficiently on **low-power hardware**  
✔ Provides **immediate authentication feedback in the field**  
✔ Supports **RBAC + MFA + secure firmware environments**  
✔ **Continuously learns** from emerging threat patterns  
✔ **Strengthens national security & digital media integrity**

## 🧠 System Workflow — Agentic AI Pipeline

Camera / Media Input  
⬇  
Frame & Audio Sampling  
⬇  
Face + Speech Detection (Offline ML Kit)  
⬇  
Face/Auditory Feature Extraction  
⬇  
Deepfake Detection Models (TensorFlow Lite — Edge)  
⬇  
Compression-Aware & Temporal Consistency Checks  
⬇  
Threat Confidence Estimation + Smoothing

## 🔐 Security & Ethics Principles

Abhaya-Netra is built as a **privacy-first security tool**:

• No raw media leaves the device  
• Role-restricted authentication  
• Explainable probability-based outputs  
• Secure firmware alignment  
• Tamper-aware deployment *(planned)*  

> This system supports trusted verification —  
> **it does not replace legal or investigative judgment.**

## 🛠 Setup (Developer Build)


`app/src/main/assets/model.tflite`


(Models are excluded from Git for security & size reasons.)

---

## 🧪 Operating Modes

### 🎥 Video Authentication  
Upload or receive media → realtime analysis

### 📷 Live Field Detection  
Realtime confidence monitoring via camera input

Both support **offline inference.**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer — Responsible AI Use

Abhaya-Netra provides **probabilistic risk estimation — not proof.**  
It must **only** be used for:

✔ public safety  
✔ threat response  
✔ misinformation defence  
✔ lawful investigation support  

❌ NOT for harassment, surveillance abuse, or political targeting.

---

## 🗺 Strategic Roadmap

• Multi-face + temporal deepfake validation  
• Audio + voice spoof detection  
• Offline learning memory store  
• Secure cloud sync (optional)  
• National-scale deployment readiness  
• Cross-platform & device portability
